         <p align="center">At its core, Git is a set of command line utility programs that are designed to execute on a Unix style command-line environment. Modern operating systems like Linux and macOS both include built-in Unix command line terminals.</p>
         <p align="center">In Windows environments, Git is often packaged as part of higher level GUI applications. GUIs for Git may attempt to abstract and hide the underlying version control system primitives. This can be a great aid for Git beginners to rapidly contribute to a project.</p>

                 <p><strong>CD</strong> happens to be my favourite git command, the first command i learnt in git command line (Git Bash), <strong>CD</strong> simply means <em>Change Directory</em></p><br>
                 <h3>Function of CD:</h3>
                 <p>"CD" helps user to change current working directory or switch into a Directory (folder), which really is a great deal when it comes to do with formating of directories</p>
                 <p>CD command can be used with: <strong>".." or "~"</strong> flags.</p>
                 <h3>Exammple:</h3>
                 <p>With (<strong>CD .. </strong>) you move a step back from a current working directory to immediate following directory, also</p>
                 <p>With (<strong>CD ~</strong>) you move from a current working directory to a home directory, which is the begining of your directories</p>
                 <h3>Simple example of how this commands work</h3>
